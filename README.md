- Easily start analysis for a model with a few lines of code. Cobalt readily supports text, image, and tabular datasets.
- Automatically identify problematic groups of data in your model, saving days or weeks of data scientist troubleshooting effort.
- Use the groups discovered by Cobalt to target the most important data for retraining or fine-tuning, and create test cases to catch future regressions.
