# BlueLightAI

Welcome to BlueLightAI's GitHub! We build tools to help AI developers
understand and improve their models. 

## Cobalt

BlueLightAI Cobalt runs inside your Jupyter notebook and automatically
generates insights into model performance, giving suggestions for improvement.

- Easily start analysis for a model with a few lines of code. Cobalt readily
  supports text, image, and tabular datasets.
- Automatically identify problematic groups of data in your model, saving days
  or weeks of data scientist troubleshooting effort.
- Use the groups discovered by Cobalt to target the most important data for
  retraining or fine-tuning, and create test cases to catch future regressions.
